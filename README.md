## Sorting Visualizer
- The Sorting Visualizer is an educational tool designed for computer science students to review and understand various sorting algorithms. It provides a graphical interface that allows students to visualize how different sorting algorithms manipulate arrays of numbers to sort them into ascending order. This project aims to facilitate learning and comprehension of fundamental computer science concepts related to sorting algorithms.

## Features
- Sorting Algorithms: The visualizer supports several commonly taught sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Selection Sort.
- Interactive Visualization: Arrays of random numbers are visually represented as bars on a canvas, allowing students to see the current state of the array at each step of the sorting process.
- Real-time Animation: Sorting algorithms are animated in real-time, providing a dynamic and engaging way for students to observe how the algorithms work.
- Customizable Parameters: Students can control the size of the array and the speed of the sorting animations to tailor the learning experience to their preferences.
- Educational Resource: Designed specifically for computer science students, the visualizer serves as a supplementary tool for reviewing sorting algorithms taught in computer science courses.
